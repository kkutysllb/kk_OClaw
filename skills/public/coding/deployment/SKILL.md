## Purpose

Move verified software into a runnable environment safely.

3. Define required secrets and environment variables.
4. Run smoke checks after deployment.
5. Prepare rollback or mitigation steps.

## Review Checklist

- Deployment commands are reproducible.
- Secrets are not committed.
- Health checks and logs are accessible.
- Rollback path is known before release.
