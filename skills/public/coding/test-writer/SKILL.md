# Test Writer Skill

## Purpose

Create focused automated tests that prove behavior, catch regressions, and keep
the review surface small.

## Workflow

1. Identify the behavior contract before touching implementation code.
2. Prefer the narrowest test level that proves the behavior: unit for pure
   logic, integration for API/data boundaries, and E2E only for critical flows.
3. Write or update the failing test first when fixing a bug or changing
   behavior.
4. Use realistic inputs and avoid over-mocking the code under test.
5. Run the specific test file, then the relevant broader suite.

## Review Checklist

- Test name states the behavior, not the implementation.
- The test fails for the expected reason before the fix.
- Fixtures are local, minimal, and easy to read.
- Edge cases cover empty input, invalid input, and boundary values when relevant.
- No sleep-based timing assertions unless the project already uses that pattern.
